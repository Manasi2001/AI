For the mathematically inclined, this is known as a powerset, and a powerset of a set (in our case, the set of items) has $2^{N}$ different possible subsets, where $N$ is the number of items. Therefore, we would need to analyze $2^{N}$ combinations $(O(2^{N}))$. This is okay for a small number of items, but it is untenable for a large number. Any approach that solves a problem\n",
