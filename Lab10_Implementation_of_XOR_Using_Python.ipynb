        "Implementing logic gates using neural networks help understand the mathematical computation by which a neural network processes its inputs to arrive at a certain output. This neural network will deal with the XOR logic problem. An XOR (exclusive OR gate) is a digital logic gate that gives a true output only when both its inputs differ from each other. The truth table for an XOR gate is shown below:\n",
